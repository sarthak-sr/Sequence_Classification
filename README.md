# Sequence_Classification
Using BERT model from Hugging face library for classification of tweets into 9 different lables.

To replicate the model
- Upload the .ipynb file into Google Collab noteboook
- Upload the app.py file
- Upload the original provided dataset .xlsx file or use your own data set with minor code changes. 
- Change runtime from CPU to GPU
- Run all (approx runtime 10 mins on GPU)
- Use the resultant link to access the streamlit application
- Watch the demo_video.mp4 for app demostration
- Read the Documentaion.pdf file for code walkthrough and other insights.
- EDA done in same Google Collab Notebook.
